### **Code Analysis**

This Python program utilizes the **stack** data structure to demonstrate four different functionalities:

1. **String Reversal** using a stack.
2. **Balanced Parentheses Checking** using a stack.
3. **Basic Stack Operations** (such as `append`, `pop`, and checking the size).
4. **Decimal to Binary Conversion** using a stack.

Let's break down each section and examine how the program works and what the expected output will be.

### **1. String Reversal (`reverse_string`)**

This function reverses a given string using a stack:

- **Process**: Each character of the string is pushed onto the stack. Since a stack is Last In First Out (LIFO), popping the characters off the stack will reverse the string.
- **Code Explanation**:
  - A stack is initialized as an empty list.
  - The string is looped through, and each character is appended to the stack.
  - Then, characters are popped off the stack and appended to `reversed_str` to form the reversed string.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `"Hello, Stack!"`
  - Output: `"!kcats ,olleH"`

---

### **2. Balanced Parentheses Checking (`is_balanced`)**

This function checks whether the parentheses in a string are balanced:

- **Process**:
  - For each character, if it's an opening parenthesis (`(`, `{`, `[`), it's pushed onto the stack.
  - If it's a closing parenthesis (`)`, `}`, `]`), it checks whether the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening parenthesis.
  - If a mismatch is found, it returns `False`.
  - At the end of the string, if the stack is empty (i.e., all parentheses have been matched), the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- **Example**:
  - Balanced Input: `"{[()]}"` → Output: `True`
  - Unbalanced Input: `"{[(])}"` → Output: `False`

### **3. Basic Stack Operations**

This part demonstrates basic stack operations using the list as a stack:

- **Operations**:
  - Push `10`, `20`, and `30` onto the stack.
  - Retrieve the top element (`stack[-1]`).
  - Get the size of the stack using `len(stack)`.
  - Pop an element from the stack and check the new top element.
  - Check if the stack is empty.
- **Example**:
  - Initial Stack: `[10, 20, 30]`
  - Output:
    - Top element: `30`
    - Stack size: `3`
    - After popping, the new top element: `20`
    - Stack empty status: `False`

---

### **4. Decimal to Binary Conversion**

This part converts a decimal number to binary using a stack:

- **Process**:
  - Divide the decimal number by 2, and push the remainder (either `0` or `1`) onto the stack.
  - Continue dividing by 2 until the decimal number becomes 0.
  - Pop the binary digits from the stack to get the binary representation in the correct order.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `25`
  - Binary Conversion Steps:
    - `25 ÷ 2 = 12, remainder 1` → Stack: `[1]`
    - `12 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder 0` → Stack: `[1, 0]`
    - `6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 0` → Stack: `[1, 0, 0]`
    - `3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1` → Stack: `[1, 0, 0, 1]`
    - `1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1` → Stack: `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - Output: `"11001"`

---

### **Expected Output**

1. **Reversed String**:
   ```
   Reversed string: !kcats ,olleH
   ```

2. **Balanced Parentheses Check**:
   - For `"{[()]}"` (balanced):
     ```
     Balanced string check: True
     ```
   - For `"{[(])}"` (unbalanced):
     ```
     Unbalanced string check: False
     ```

3. **Stack Operations**:
   ```
   Stack operations:
   Top element: 30
   Stack size: 3
   Top element after pop: 20
   Is stack empty? False
   ```

4. **Binary Representation**:
   ```
   Binary representation of 25: 11001
   ```

---

### **Final Output:**

```
Reversed string: !kcats ,olleH
Balanced string check: True
Unbalanced string check: False

Stack operations:
Top element: 30
Stack size: 3
Top element after pop: 20
Is stack empty? False

Binary representation of 25: 11001
```

### **Time and Space Complexity**

1. **String Reversal (`reverse_string`)**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` (each character is pushed and popped once).
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` (the stack stores all the characters).

2. **Balanced Parentheses Check (`is_balanced`)**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` (each character is processed once).
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` (in the worst case, all characters are pushed onto the stack).

3. **Basic Stack Operations**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` for `append`, `pop`, and size checking.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` (since the stack stores elements).

4. **Decimal to Binary Conversion**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` (since the number of iterations depends on the logarithm of the number with base 2).
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(log n)` (since the stack stores remainders).

---

### **Conclusion**

This program effectively demonstrates the utility of a stack for common problems like string reversal, balanced parentheses checking, stack operations, and decimal-to-binary conversion. The output is consistent with expectations, and the code is efficient in handling the tasks with linear and logarithmic time complexities depending on the operation.
