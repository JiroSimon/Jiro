### **Code Analysis**

This Python code implements a **Circular Queue** using a list and a circular index mechanism. The main operations of a queue are implemented: `enqueue` (to add elements), `dequeue` (to remove elements), and `display` (to show the current elements of the queue).

---

### **Class: `CircularQueue`**

1. **Attributes:**
    - `self.SIZE`: The maximum capacity of the queue (default is 5).
    - `self.items`: A list initialized with `None` to hold the elements of the queue.
    - `self.front`: Index of the front element of the queue (initialized to `-1` meaning the queue is empty).
    - `self.rear`: Index of the rear element of the queue (initialized to `-1` meaning the queue is empty).

2. **Methods:**

    - **`__init__(self, size=5)`**:
        - Initializes the circular queue with a given size (default size is 5). It also initializes the queue as empty by setting `front` and `rear` to `-1`.

    - **`is_full(self)`**:
        - Returns `True` if the queue is full. The condition checks if the rear index is one position before the front index in a circular manner using modulo (`(self.rear + 1) % self.SIZE == self.front`).

    - **`is_empty(self)`**:
        - Returns `True` if the queue is empty (when `front == -1`).

    - **`enqueue(self, value)`**:
        - Adds an element (`value`) to the queue. It first checks if the queue is full, and if so, it prints "Queue is full!". If the queue is empty (`front == -1`), the `front` is set to `0`. Then, the rear is incremented circularly using modulo, and the item is inserted in the queue at the `rear`.

    - **`dequeue(self)`**:
        - Removes an element from the front of the queue. It checks if the queue is empty, and if so, it prints "Queue is empty!". If the queue has only one element (`front == rear`), it sets both `front` and `rear` to `-1`. Otherwise, it increments the `front` index circularly using modulo.

    - **`display(self)`**:
        - Displays the elements in the queue. It starts from the `front` index and prints the elements one by one, using a circular approach by moving the index forward (`(i + 1) % self.SIZE`). If the queue is empty, it prints "Queue is empty!".

### **Example Usage**

```python
q = CircularQueue()  # Creates a circular queue of size 5
q.enqueue(10)        # Adds 10 to the queue
q.enqueue(20)        # Adds 20 to the queue
q.enqueue(30)        # Adds 30 to the queue
q.enqueue(40)        # Adds 40 to the queue
q.enqueue(50)        # Adds 50 to the queue
q.display()          # Displays the current queue
```

- After this, the queue will contain `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, and the `display()` method will print:
  ```
  Queue elements: 10 20 30 40 50
  ```

Next, we dequeue one element:

```python
q.dequeue()          # Removes the front element (10)
```

- After dequeuing, the queue will contain `[20, 30, 40, 50]`, and it prints:
  ```
  Dequeued: 10
  ```

Finally, we add one more element:

```python
q.enqueue(60)        # Adds 60 to the queue
q.display()          # Displays the current queue
```

- After this, the queue will contain `[20, 30, 40, 50, 60]`, and the `display()` method will print:
  ```
  Queue elements: 20 30 40 50 60
  ```

### **Expected Output**

```
Queue elements: 10 20 30 40 50
Dequeued: 10
Queue elements: 20 30 40 50 60
```

### **Explanation of Operations**

1. **Enqueue operations**:
    - When each element is enqueued, the queue checks if it is full. If not, it inserts the element at the `rear` and adjusts the `rear` index circularly.
    - Initially, when the queue is empty (`front == -1`), it sets `front = 0` and inserts the first element.
    - When the queue is not full, it keeps inserting elements at the `rear`.

2. **Dequeue operation**:
    - The first dequeue operation removes the element at the `front` (10). After the removal, the `front` pointer moves to the next index (1). The `rear` remains at 4 (as no elements were removed from the rear side).
    - After dequeuing, if the queue only has one element (i.e., `front == rear`), the `front` and `rear` are reset to `-1` to indicate an empty queue.
    - Otherwise, `front` is incremented circularly.

3. **Display operation**:
    - The display operation starts from `front` and prints each element one by one, moving circularly using modulo arithmetic. It continues until it reaches `rear`, then prints a newline.

### **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **`enqueue`**: `O(1)` - Inserting an element takes constant time since it only involves updating the `rear` index and placing the value.
  - **`dequeue`**: `O(1)` - Removing an element takes constant time as it only involves updating the `front` index.
  - **`display`**: `O(n)` - The method must traverse the entire queue (up to `n` elements), printing each one.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - **`O(n)`** - The space used is proportional to the size of the queue, where `n` is the number of elements in the queue. The space is used to store the queue elements in the `items` list.

This code efficiently manages the circular queue operations and provides an easy-to-understand implementation using Python's list structure.
